3. Civilians will not break the priority guidelines (listed below) under any circumstances.

4. If a civilian wishes to do a scene that involves any form of investigation they must first consult the supervising officer of all active LEO departments.

5. Civilians must honor FailRP, New Life Rule, Power Gaming, and Metagaming policies detailed in the rules of GORP.

6. If a civilian wishes to enact revenge towards anyone they must wait at least 2 patrols to do so.

7. Civilians must adhere to the Priority cooldown of 20 Minutes, initiating a priority while the cooldown is active will result in an immediate kick. (this includes initiating a pursuit on a traffic stop that started before the cooldown ended)

8. Pursuits shall be maintained at reasonable speeds, any pursuit exceeding 130 Km/h will be called off by supervising LEO immediately and disregarded as failRP.

9. Civilians are to keep up with all /do, /me/, or other text interactions directed towards their scene. Use /OOC for anything Out Of Character.

10. Civilians are expected to diversify their characters, not every person is going to be a rich guy with a Lambo, or cop-hating sovereign citizens, switch up your scene interactions and make them unique.

11. Civilians are required to register all characters in the GORP CAD system, as well as vehicles, if a vehicle is not registered then it is to be roleplayed as either stolen or unregistered. Even if a character or vehicle is a 1 use resource.

12. No use of any Police, Fire, or EMS vehicles unless obtained legitimately and with prior permission.

14. Animal Peds shall not be used by Civilians III or IV without permission from a Civilian Supervisor or higher.

15. Civilians must remain 100% in character at all times, if an issue is presented either take it up in dm’s or wait until patrol ends. This means no OOC voice comms, people record and stream and this can reflect badly on the community.

16. Civilians must keep their Roleplay to a certain level of realism and things that happen day to day in Ontario, so no shootings every five minutes, calls don’t always have to end in a pursuit or shootout. We like common calls such as disturbances or traffic stops; not every scene has to be a priority.

17. There is no place for nonsensical calls on our server. If you want to goof off you can join a public server. We try to offer a realistic server for our members to enjoy no talking monkeys or people yelling into their microphones to be annoying.
