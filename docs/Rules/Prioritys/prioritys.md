# Prioritys


### The Following calls for service ideas from Priority 1-3 all do not classify as a roleplay scenario which will initiate a Priority Cooldown. 

### A Priority Cooldown is initiated following when;
    - An incident where shots are fired towards emergency personnel
    - A pursuit that exceeds 2 Minutes is conducted
    - Any call which involves kidnapping or harm of emergency personnel.

### The following ideas are realistic situations that occur throughout the Greater Ontario Area frequently and will allow civilians to be more creative and allow for an overall lively patrol. 

### It is important as a Civilian Operations member that you balance out your roleplay scenarios with scenes.

### This means prior to conducting a scene that would initiate a priority cooldown you should always be doing a healthy amount of Priority 3,2,1 Calls in that Order.

### This allows for a gradual increase in intensity for everyone involved.

### Lastly, It is the responsibility of the civilian to ensure that the call for service they are doing falls within the parameters of their civ level.
