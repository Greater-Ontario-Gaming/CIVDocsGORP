# Senior Civilian

## These are civilians who have leadership qualities and may be asked to give less experienced civilians guidance to improve their roleplaying,
## Such as having newer Civs participate in their scenes, and providing Out Of Character counsel
## These ranks are voluntary and will not be forced on members who are not confident in leading.
