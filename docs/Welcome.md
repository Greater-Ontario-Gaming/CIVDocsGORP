# GORP Civilian Documentation

Welcome to the Civilian Department for Greater Ontario RolePlay

We in the civilian department of Greater Ontario Roleplay aim to bring inclusive, fun roleplay, storytelling, and realism to the community through realistic and in-depth character-building and acting including LEO, Fire, and EMS.

This document will outline the expectations of each member of civilian operations, as well as a guide for quality RP. This will include the expected standard of roleplay, conduct, and more. Failure to maintain these rules will result in swift disciplinary actions.
