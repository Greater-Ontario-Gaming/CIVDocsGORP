# Tow Trucks

The tow department is now run by the Civilian Department. That means that when a tow truck is needed dispatch will join the Civs in Teamspeak and ask if anyone is available. From then on you will get a tow truck and respond to the scene however you feel, (Tow trucks are not emergency services, all laws apply)

Tow operators will show up on scene and tow the vehicle with professionalism as an officer is likely to be on scene. The operator will take the vehicle to where directed by the officer.
